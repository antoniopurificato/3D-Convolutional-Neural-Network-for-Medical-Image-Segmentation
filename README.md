# 3D-Convolutional-Neural-Network-for-Medical-Image-Segmentation
The goal of the first task of this project is to modify the U-shaped architecture of the classical convolutional neural network for MRI (U-Net) using an attention mechanism. In this mode the quality of the reconstructed images is improved but the computational complexity remains the same.
The goal of the second task of this project is to implement the network in TensorFlow and use this network for the analysis of a breast cancer dataset (BUSI).
All the code is written  in Python, and can be runned in Google Colab.
